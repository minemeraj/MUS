\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}
Many real-world problems have arised in formal verification of hardware and software which can be formulated as constraint satisfaction problems and translated it into Boolean formulas in Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF) (see Section $2.1$ for details). Boolean satisfiability (SAT) solvers determine whether a formula is satisfiable or unsatisfiable. When a formula is unsatisfiable, it is required to find unsatisfiable and minimal subsets where each subset is a set of clauses. Minimal Unsatisfiable subsets (MUSes), also called Minimal Unsatisfiable Cores (MUCs), are essential to determine the reasons for the failure of the system. In the past few years, the interest and research on the extraction of MUSes of an unsatisfiable constraint system has been increasing, but most of the research has concentrated on the algorithms to extract a single MUS \cite{karem}. This single MUS may not provide complete information about the failure of constraint system, because the system might have multiple MUSes and the appearance of any one makes the system unsatisfiable.\newline
In this paper, we are explaining some algorithms which are necessary to compute all MUSes of a system as in \cite{karem}. The paper is organized as follows. Section $2$ presents some preliminaries with formal definitions. We introduce the algorithms in details in Section $3$ and conclude in Section $4$.
