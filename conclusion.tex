\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
We have discussed a set of algorithms which generate MUSs and also the authors made a framework consisting of the algorithms. The generation of MUSs is based on the duality of MCSs and MUSs. The algorithms can be used to work with different types of constraint solvers. The algorithms (may be with small modification) can be used on top of new constraint solvers to provide the functionality of finding MUSs for new types of constraints.
