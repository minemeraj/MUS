\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
We have described the solving technique of non-linear equalities with virtual substitution step by step. It has two steps. One is to construct test candidates with side conditions and another one is to replace a variable by a test candidate in a formula. It has already said that the replacement is based on some substitution rules.Finally, we can have the solutions for which the formula is satisfied.
