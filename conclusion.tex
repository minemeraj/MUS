\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
We have discussed a set of algorithms which generate MUSes and also authors made a framework consisting of the algorithms. The generation of MUSes is based on the duality of MCSes and MUSes. The algorithms can be used to work with different types of constraint solvers. Authors have implemented the algorithms on a solver for Disjunctive Temporal Problems (DTPs) [26] and using YICES [14], an efficient Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) solver which covers a wide range of constraint types [1]. That's why, the algorithms (may be with small modification) can be used on top of new constraint solvers to provide the functionality of finding MUSes for new types of constraints.
