\begin{abstract}
We present a procedure as published in \cite{weispfenning} which computes all the solutions of non-linear equalities with virtual substitution.The solution approach relies on some substitution rules of virtual substitution. The rules can be applied only on the real-arithmetic formulas which is linear or quadratic.
