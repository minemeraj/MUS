\begin{abstract}
	Write a short abstract. Do not give to much details here, but
	arouse the readers interest. A nice opportunity to comment the 
	text is given by the following:
	%\Author{This is a comment of the
	%author (you).} \Supervisor{This is a comment
	%of the supervisor.} 
	Especially if you write in german, you sometimes need to specify
	the hyphanation, as e.g. for the word 
	thisisaverylongwordwhosehyphanationmustbedefined.
