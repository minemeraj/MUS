\begin{abstract}
We present a procedure as published in [1] which computes all Minimal Unsatisfiable Subsets (MUSes) of unsatisfiable constraint system. Authors have developed a complete algorithm to compute all MUSes and introduced to us two phases, one is generating all Minimal Correction Subsets (MCSes) and another one is generating all MUSes. Removing an MCS makes the unsatisfiable constraint system satisfiable. Also removing any clause from an MUS implies that the remaining set of clauses is not an unsatisfiable subset anymore.
