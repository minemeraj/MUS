\begin{abstract}
We present a procedure as published in \cite{karem} which computes all Minimal Unsatisfiable Subsets (MUSs) of an unsatisfiable constraint system. The authors have developed a complete algorithm to compute all MUSs in two phases, one is generating all Minimal Correction Subsets (MCSs) and another one is generating all MUSs. Removing an MCS makes the unsatisfiable constraint system satisfiable. Also removing one clause from each MUS implies that the remaining set of clauses is not unsatisfiable anymore.
